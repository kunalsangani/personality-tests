Rather, it means you tend to draw energy from quiet time rather than from people, objects, or activities per se. You might enjoy spending time with others, especially close friends who you feel you can be yourself with, though you might find yourself craving some time to re-charge after a marathon of social events.",
					"You tend to draw energy from time to yourself. This doesn't mean you're antisocial or unfriendly: Instead, your energy is more directed toward the world of reflection and ideas than people or objects. This often gives you a unique outlook on your surroundings, and you might seek out strong one-on-one friendships with others who see the world the same way you do.",
